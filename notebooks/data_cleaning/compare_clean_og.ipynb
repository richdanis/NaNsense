He has spent about 300 days in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit of Oklahoma Children’s Hospital awaiting a new heart. He was born in December 2023 in Tulsa and quickly airlifted to Oklahoma’s Children’s Hospital and added to the transplant list in March 2024.\\nParker’s parents, Faith and David, shared their joy with a simple phrase, “There’s an angel in heaven who left their heart for me.”\\nThe achievement means Oklahoma children and their families no longer need to leave the state for this life-saving care. An estimated five children a year in Oklahoma have had to leave the state for transplants over the past decade.\\n“With a successful pediatric heart transplant in Oklahoma, this is the final step in ensuring that the children of Oklahoma have access to all cardiac care without having to leave the state,” said pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon\\nDr. Harold Burkhart, M.D.\\n, professor of surgery and Chief of the Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine and director of the Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgical Program at Oklahoma Children\\'s Hospital. “This incredibly important milestone is 10 years in the making, and I am deeply honored and immensely proud of our team’s life-saving efforts.\"\\nOklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health joins an elite list of approximately 65 health systems offering this highly specialized pediatric surgical care for children. The team includes experienced pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiologists and advanced practice providers who utilize the latest treatment protocols and advanced techniques. Their work, including participation in clinical trials, has led to significant medical breakthroughs in pediatric cardiac care.\\nFor the Helmerichs, it meant they were able to remain close to home as Parker awaited life-saving surgery. He will be able to continue to receive follow-up care close to home, surrounded by family, and begin his recovery process and ongoing care.\\nIn February 2024, Oklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health Heart Center\\nlisted its first pediatric patient for a donor heart\\nwith the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), marking a significant milestone in pediatric cardiac care for the state and region. This breakthrough revives Oklahoma’s pediatric heart transplant program, dormant since the 1990s. As the state’s sole pediatric heart transplant center, the Heart Center is a vital hub for advanced cardiac care, serving children across Oklahoma and beyond.\\nIn preparation for the new transplant program, Oklahoma Children\\'s Hospital opened the state\\'s only 25-bed pediatric cardiac intensive care unit in 2022, dedicated exclusively to children with heart conditions, including transplant patients.\\n“Oklahoma now boasts a fully comprehensive pediatric heart transplant center, enabling us to deliver the highest level of coordinated care for our young transplant patients,” said pediatric cardiologist\\nDr. R Erik Edens, M.D., Ph.D.\\n“This program bridges the final gap in treating pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. This first successful pediatric heart transplant is just another step in ensuring our youngest patients can receive top-tier heart care right here at home.”\\n\\u200b\\nDr. Burkhart moved to Oklahoma in 2014 to build the pediatric cardiac surgery program at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital. The pediatric cardiac surgery team at Oklahoma Children\\'s Hospital now performs more than 500 surgeries annually, with a 98.8% survival rate for open-heart surgery — above the national average regardless of complexity.\\nU.S. News & World Report has recognized the program as a Top 50 Best Children’s Hospitals in the nation for Pediatric Cardiology & Heart Surgery for its 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 rankings. In addition, Oklahoma Children’s Hospital received the 2021 Mended Hearts International, Regional, Divisional, and National Hospital of the Year awards.\\n“Our mission at OU Health is to be the premier destination for Oklahomans facing severe and life-threatening conditions, leveraging our academic environment and expert teams equipped with advanced technology and knowledge,” said\\nDr. Richard Lofgren, M.D., MPH\\n, president and CEO of OU Health. “When it comes to children, no parent wants to face an away game for their children’s healthcare and this major milestone for our team is another step forward in keeping Oklahoma’s kids here in Oklahoma for the advanced care they need.”\\n\\u200b\\nEach year, approximately 450 pediatric heart transplants are performed in the United States. Heart failure in children can result from cardiomyopathy, congenital heart defects or other medical conditions that damage the heart. Regardless of the cause, children with severe heart issues may require a heart transplant to survive.\\nChildren with congenital heart disease often undergo one to three open-heart surgeries before receiving a transplant. A heart transplant can significantly extend and improve their lives. The wait for a suitable donor organ can range from days to years, with allocation prioritized based on medical urgency, blood type and distance between donor and recipient hospitals.\\nLearn more about the\\nOklahoma Children\\'s Hospital OU Health Heart Center\\n,\\xa0including our\\nsurgical outcomes\\nand\\nsurgery services\\nprovided or call us at\\n(405) 271 - 4411\\nRelated Blogs\\nBreakthrough Type 1 Diabetes Drug Now Offered at OU Health\\nNews\\nContinue Reading\\nComplex Spinal Surgery for a Rare Growth Disorder — Carissah’s Story\\nChildren\\nContinue Reading\\nFrom Struggle to Strength: Ross’s Recovery from a Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health\\nFeatured, Children\\nContinue Reading\\nFeatured Blogs\\nFrom Struggle to Strength: Ross’s ...\\nFeatured, Children\\nSara and Jon Helms found out they were expecting their first baby during a particularly busy and stressful period in their lives.

Key areas of research include cancer, diabetes,\\n\\t neuroscience and vision, and infectious diseases and immunology.\\nTypes of Research\\nThe academic specialists and researchers at OU Health perform several types\\n\\t of research with the overarching goal to help people of all ages who live\\n\\t with or experience a variety of health conditions.\\nBasic Science Research\\nIn basic science research, usually conducted in a laboratory, scientists\\n\\t seek to improve our understanding of how the human body works when it’s\\n\\t well and when it’s sick. Basic science research studies may examine:\\nThe role of a protein that triggers cachexia, a muscle-wasting condition\\n\\t\\t\\t that occurs in 80% of people who have pancreatic cancer.\\nBacteria that seeps into microscopic cracks of a tooth cavity filling and\\n\\t\\t\\t ways to improve the adhesive resin of the filling to attack the bacteria.\\nWhat role inflammation plays in both aging and age-related diseases like cancer.\\nTranslational Research\\nTranslational research takes discoveries made in basic science laboratories\\n\\t and investigates ways to translate them into actual treatments for patients.\\n\\t Often described as moving from “the bench to the bedside,”\\n\\t translational research looks for ways to transform research and move it\\n\\t from the laboratory bench to the patient’s bedside. In this approach,\\n\\t a researcher may:\\nCollaborate with a biotechnology company to discover targets that will\\n\\t\\t\\t help the body’s immune system find and kill cells infected with\\n\\t\\t\\t the COVID-19 virus. The research outcomes would then be used to develop\\n\\t\\t\\t a vaccine for COVID-19.\\nDevelop a compound that’s been shown in the laboratory to prevent\\n\\t\\t\\t formation of ovarian cancer tumors without side effects. The drug is now\\n\\t\\t\\t being tested in humans in a clinical trial.\\nDiscover the biological root of unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms.\\n\\t\\t\\t The discovery has been translated into a panel of tests now used around\\n\\t\\t\\t the world to diagnose neuropsychiatric disorders in children.\\nClinical Research & Clinical Trials\\nClinical research focuses on specific solutions and examines how they function\\n\\t in humans. Clinical research often takes the form of clinical trials –\\n\\t studies performed in humans to determine whether new drugs and other therapies\\n\\t are safe and effective for specific diseases. Through OU Health’s\\n\\t facilities like Stephenson Cancer Center, Oklahoma’s only National\\n\\t Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, you can receive the newest\\n\\t and most innovative treatments available through clinical trials and gain\\n\\t access to the state’s only\\nPhase I clinical trials\\nprogram.\\nAt OU Health, clinical research explores a wide range of topics and may\\n\\t include a variety of specific projects. For example:\\nA cardiologist studies the effectiveness of a non-invasive stimulation\\n\\t\\t\\t of the vagus nerve to regulate the abnormal heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation.\\n\\t\\t\\t A small device connected to a person’s ear delivers a low-level\\n\\t\\t\\t electrical stimulation to the nerve.\\nA pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon treats babies born with hypoplastic\\n\\t\\t\\t left heart syndrome (HLHS) and studies the effectiveness of injecting\\n\\t\\t\\t the baby’s umbilical cord blood cells directly into the heart to\\n\\t\\t\\t improve heart function.\\nA clinical trial studies the effectiveness of a drug for women with ovarian\\n\\t\\t\\t cancer who have undergone four or more rounds of chemotherapy.\\nHow Academic Medical Research Benefits You\\nBringing advanced research directly to the healthcare services you receive\\n\\t makes OU Health different from other healthcare systems in Oklahoma and\\n\\t across the region. When you and your family work with the experts and\\n\\t specialists at OU Health, part of your care happens at our Oklahoma City\\n\\t campus, home to the largest and most advanced biomedical infrastructure\\n\\t in Oklahoma and the researchers who receive awards of millions of dollars\\n\\t in state and federal grants annually. Those resources provide momentum\\n\\t for our healthcare commitment – to improve the quality of life for\\n\\t you and your loved ones and to discover new methods for preventing, treating\\n\\t and curing diseases we all face.\\nLearn More\\nDiscover how OU Health scientists decipher the mysteries of human disease\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t that hold great promise for innovations to improve your health and well-being.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Learn more about research at the\\nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.\\nResearch & Innovation\\nClinical Trials at OU Health\\nSee how you benefit from OU Health services in the community\\nLearn More\\nDiscover what patient-centered care means for you\\nLearn More\\nI want to...\\nView All OU Health Services\\nLog In To Patient Portal\\nRequest Medical Records\\nSend a Greeting\\nSearch eHealth Library\\n700 NE 13th St\\nOklahoma City\\n,\\nOK\\n73104\\nMap + Directions\\nFor Hospital Information:\\n(405) 271-4700\\nFor appointments:\\n(405) 271-2222\\nAbout OU Health\\nBilling & Insurance\\nCalendar & Events\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nCOVID-19 Services & Treatments\\neHealth Library\\nMedical Records\\nNewsroom & Media\\nNotice of Privacy Practices\\nOU Health in the Community\\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\\nPhysician Access & Logins\\nPrice Transparency\\nVendor Registration & Login\\nWays to Give\\nx\\n⚠\\nYour browser is out of date.

And a good person to start with is your healthcare provider.\\n\\t Once you have made your decisions and plans, share them with family members\\n\\t and other care providers.\\nWhat is Advance Care Planning and Why Is It Important?\\nAdvance Care Planning is the process of making decisions in advance of\\n an illness or injury to express your choices if you became unable to communicate\\n those choices yourself. Many people do not think about planning for their\\n end-of-life care until they are older or very sick. However, anyone over\\n the age of 18 should make a plan in case of a serious disease, accident,\\n or sudden emergency such as surgery while able to do so. Oklahoma law\\n assumes that persons want all possible treatment to keep them alive unless\\n a completed Advance Directive Form states otherwise.\\nWhy Do I Need Advance Care Planning?\\nNot only will planning for your care give you peace of mind, it will lessen\\n the suffering of your loved ones. Without a written plan, you would receive\\n all necessary medical treatment in the event you suddenly became sick\\n or injured. If you were unable to speak for yourself, doctors would not\\n know your wishes and your loved ones might be scared, overwhelmed, or\\n unsure of what to do. You might already have strong beliefs about:\\nWho you would like to make health care decisions for you.\\nWhat treatments you would agree to or refuse in order to keep you alive.\\nWhere you choose to spend the last days of your life.\\nFinancial costs for treatments that may keep you alive but not make you better.\\nWhat is an Advance Directive?\\nAn Advance Directive form is a legal document that allows you to write\\n down your wishes for healthcare treatment during the end-stage of your\\n life. This form will also allow you to appoint someone to be your voice\\n (Health Care Proxy) if you are unable to speak for yourself. It is important\\n to know that this form only becomes valid if two doctors have determined\\n that you are unable to make medical decisions.\\nAn Advance Directive Allows You To:\\nChoose a person to make health care choices for you. You can also choose\\n\\t\\t an alternate\\n(back-up) person in the event your first choice is unable to speak for you.\\nIndicate what health care treatments you would agree to or refuse.\\nChoose if you would like to accept or refuse life support for certain conditions.\\nIndicate if you would like to donate your body or organs for medical research\\n\\t\\t or people waiting\\non transplant.\\nCheck your knowledge of advanced directives with this quiz\\n.\\nDownload and refer to the document below.\\nOU Health Patients & Families\\nPatient Portals\\nOU Health MyChart FAQs\\nVideo Visit Support\\nSchedule Your Appointment\\nHospital Charges, Pricing & Transparency\\nRequest Medical Records\\nRequest Medical Records - OU Health Physicians Tulsa\\nInsurance & Billing\\nInsurance - OU Health Physicians\\nInsurance - OU Health Hospitals & ERs\\nBilling - OU Health Physicians\\nBilling - OU Health Hospitals & ERs\\nFinancial Assistance Programs\\nNo Surprises Act\\nOnline Bill Pay\\nInsurance - SoonerSelect\\nPet Therapy\\nSpiritual Care\\nAdvanced Care Planning for Medical Decisions\\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\\nHealth Care Equality\\nNotice of Privacy Practices\\neHealth Library\\nSend a Greeting\\nDAISY Award Nomination\\nAbout OU Health\\nAbout OU Health Physicians\\nSee how you benefit from OU Health services in the community\\nLearn More\\nDiscover what patient-centered care means for you\\nLearn More\\nI want to...\\nView All OU Health Services\\nLog In To Patient Portal\\nRequest Medical Records\\nSend a Greeting\\nSearch eHealth Library\\n700 NE 13th St\\nOklahoma City\\n,\\nOK\\n73104\\nMap + Directions\\nFor Hospital Information:\\n(405) 271-4700\\nFor appointments:\\n(405) 271-2222\\nAbout OU Health\\nBilling & Insurance\\nCalendar & Events\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nCOVID-19 Services & Treatments\\neHealth Library\\nMedical Records\\nNewsroom & Media\\nNotice of Privacy Practices\\nOU Health in the Community\\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\\nPhysician Access & Logins\\nPrice Transparency\\nVendor Registration & Login\\nWays to Give\\nx\\n⚠\\nYour browser is out of date.

It applies to the health\\n\\t information that is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and\\n\\t Accountability Act (HIPAA). Used to make decisions about your care, and\\n\\t generated or maintained by OU Health (OUH). Please review it carefully.\\nIf you have any questions about this notice, please contact Amber Simpson,\\n\\t the Facility Privacy Official by dialing (405) 271-5920.\\nEach time you visit a hospital, physician, or other healthcare provider,\\n\\t a record of your visit is made. Typically, this record contains your symptoms,\\n\\t examination and test results, diagnoses, treatment, a plan for future\\n\\t care or treatment, and billing-related information. This notice applies\\n\\t to all of the records of your care generated by the facility, whether\\n\\t made by facility personnel, agents of the facility, or your personal doctor.\\n\\t Your personal doctor may have different policies or notices regarding\\n\\t the doctor’s use and disclosure of your health information created\\n\\t in the doctor’s office or clinic.\\nOur Responsibilities:\\nWe are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information,\\n\\t provide you a description of our privacy practices, and to notify you\\n\\t following a breach of unsecured protected health information. We will\\n\\t abide by the terms of this notice.\\nUses and Disclosures\\nHow we may use and disclose Health Information about you.\\nThe following categories describe examples of the way we use and disclose\\n\\t health information:\\nFor Treatment:\\nWe may use health information about you to provide you treatment or services.\\n\\t We may disclose health information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians,\\n\\t medical students, or other facility personnel who are involved in taking\\n\\t care of you at the facility. For example: a doctor treating you for a\\n\\t broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may\\n\\t slow the healing process. Different departments of the facility also may\\n\\t share health information about you in order to coordinate the different\\n\\t things you may need, such as prescriptions, lab work, meals, and x-rays.\\nWe may also provide your physician or a subsequent healthcare provider\\n\\t with copies of various reports that should assist him or her in treating\\n\\t you once you’re discharged from this facility.\\nFor Payment:\\nWe may use and disclose health information about your treatment and services\\n\\t to bill and collect payment from you, your insurance company or a third\\n\\t party payer. For example, we may need to give your insurance company information\\n\\t about your surgery so they will pay us or reimburse you for the treatment.\\n\\t We may also tell your health plan about treatment you are going to receive\\n\\t to determine whether your plan will cover it. We may release your information\\n\\t to a collection agency if your account is not paid.\\nFor Health Care Operations:\\nMembers of the medical staff and/or quality improvement team may use information\\n\\t in your health record to assess the care and outcomes in your case and\\n\\t others like it. The results will then be used to continually improve the\\n\\t quality of care for all patients we serve. For example, we may combine\\n\\t health information about many patients to evaluate the need for new services\\n\\t or treatment. We may disclose information to doctors, nurses, and other\\n\\t students for educational purposes. And we may combine health information\\n\\t we have with that of other facilities to see where we can make improvements.\\n\\t We may remove information that identifies you from this set of health\\n\\t information to protect your privacy.\\nFundraising\\n: We may contact you to raise funds for the facility; however, you have\\n\\t the right to elect not to receive such communications.\\nWe may also use and disclose health information:\\nTo remind you that you have an appointment for medical care;\\nTo assess your satisfaction with our services;\\nTo tell you about possible treatment alternatives;\\nTo tell you about health–related benefits or services;\\nFor population based activities relating to improving health or reducing\\n\\t\\t health care costs;\\nFor conducting training programs or reviewing competence of health care\\n\\t\\t professionals; and\\nTo a Medicaid eligibility database and the Children’s Health Insurance\\n\\t\\t Program eligibility database, as applicable.\\nWhen disclosing information, primarily appointment reminders and billing/collections\\n\\t efforts, we may leave messages on your answering machine/voice mail.\\nBusiness Associates:\\nThere are some services provided in our organization through contracts\\n\\t with business associates.

Se aplica a la información\\n\\t médica que está protegida por la Ley de Responsabilidad\\n\\t y Portabilidad del Seguro Médico (HIPAA).

Este aviso aplica para todos\\n\\t los expedientes que se generen en el centro, ya sean generados por el\\n\\t personal del centro, los representantes del mismo o su médico personal.\\n\\t Su médico personal podría tener políticas o avisos\\n\\t diferentes con respecto al uso y divulgación que el médico\\n\\t haga de su información médica generada en el consultorio\\n\\t o clínica del médico.\\nNuestras responsabilidades:\\nNos encontramos obligados por ley a mantener la privacidad de su información\\n\\t médica, proporcionarle una descripción de nuestras prácticas\\n\\t de privacidad y de notificarle en caso de que ocurra una violación\\n\\t a la información médica protegida que no esté garantizada.\\n\\t Nosotros cumpliremos con los términos de este aviso.\\nUsos y divulgaciones:\\nCómo podemos usar y divulgar información médica sobre usted.\\nLas siguientes categorías describen ejemplos de las formas en las\\n\\t que usamos y divulgamos la información médica:\\nPara tratamiento:\\nNosotros podemos usar información médica sobre usted para\\n\\t proporcionarle tratamientos o servicios. Nosotros podremos divulgar información\\n\\t médica sobre usted a médicos, enfermeras(os), personal técnico,\\n\\t estudiantes de medicina u otros integrantes del personal del centro que\\n\\t participen en su atención en el centro. Por ejemplo: es posible\\n\\t que un médico que lo atienda por una pierna rota necesite saber\\n\\t si tiene diabetes, porque esta enfermedad puede hacer que el proceso de\\n\\t curación sea más lento. Diferentes departamentos de este\\n\\t centro también pueden compartir información médica\\n\\t sobre usted con la finalidad de coordinar diferentes cosas que usted pueda\\n\\t necesitar, tales como prescripciones, trabajo de laboratorio, comidas\\n\\t y rayos X.\\nNosotros podremos proporcionar a su médico o a un proveedor de servicios\\n\\t de salud copias de varios reportes que podrían ayudarle a brindar\\n\\t el tratamiento después de que le den de alta en este centro.\\nPara los pagos:\\nNosotros podríamos usar y divulgar la información médica\\n\\t sobre su tratamiento y sus servicios para facturar y cobrar los pagos\\n\\t ya sea a usted, a su aseguradora o a un tercero encargado del pago. Por\\n\\t ejemplo, es posible que necesitemos proporcionar información sobre\\n\\t usted a su aseguradora acerca de su cirugía para que ellos nos\\n\\t paguen o le reembolsen el costo del tratamiento. También podríamos\\n\\t informar a su plan médico acerca del tratamiento que recibirá\\n\\t para determinar si su plan lo cubre o no. Podemos divulgar su información\\n\\t a una agencia de cobranza si su cuenta no está pagada.\\nPara operaciones de atención médica:\\nLos integrantes del personal médico y/o el equipo de mejoramiento\\n\\t de la calidad podrían usar la información en su expediente\\n\\t médico para evaluar la atención y los resultados de su caso\\n\\t y otros similares. Los resultados entonces se utilizarán para el\\n\\t mejoramiento continuo de la calidad de la atención para todos los\\n\\t pacientes que atendemos. Por ejemplo, podríamos combinar la información\\n\\t médica de muchos pacientes para evaluar la necesidad de nuevos\\n\\t servicios o tratamiento. Podríamos divulgar la información\\n\\t a los médicos, las enfermeras o los estudiantes de medicina para\\n\\t fines educativos. Y podríamos combinar la información médica\\n\\t que tenemos con aquella de otros centros para ver en dónde podemos\\n\\t mejorar. Podemos eliminar la información que lo identifique de\\n\\t este conjunto de información médica a fin de proteger su\\n\\t privacidad.\\nRecaudación de fondos:\\nPodríamos comunicarnos con usted para recaudar fondos para el centro;\\n\\t sin embargo, usted tiene el derecho a elegir no recibir tales comunicados.\\nTambién podríamos usar y divulgar la información médica:\\nPara recordarle que tiene una cita para atención médica;\\nPara evaluar su satisfacción con nuestros servicios;\\nPara comentarle acerca de posibles alternativas de tratamiento;\\nPara comentarle acerca de beneficios o servicios relacionados con la salud;\\nPara actividades sociales relacionadas con el mejoramiento de la salud\\n\\t\\t o la reducción de costos de atención médica;\\nPara llevar a cabo programas de capacitación o evaluar la competencia\\n\\t\\t de los profesionales de atención médica; y\\nPara una base de datos de elegibilidad para Medicaid y base de datos de\\n\\t\\t elegibilidad para el Programa de seguro médico para los niños (\\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program\\n), en caso de ser aplicable.\\nAl divulgar información, principalmente recordatorios de citas y\\n\\t actividades de facturación/cobranza, podemos dejar mensajes en\\n\\t su máquina contestadora o buzón de voz.\\nSocios comerciales:\\nExisten algunos servicios que se proporcionan en nuestra organización\\n\\t a través de contratos con Socios comerciales.

Sin embargo, para proteger su información\\n\\t médica, los socios comerciales están obligados por ley federal\\n\\t a salvaguardar su información de manera adecuada.\\nDirectorio:\\nPodemos incluir cierta información limitada sobre usted en el directorio\\n\\t del centro mientras usted sea paciente en el mismo.

In connection with this award, OU Health was prominently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t featured in an Amwell publication, which detailed OU Health’s strategic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t implementation of a range of virtual tools for patient care.\\nOU Health Connect\\nBecause ensuring a positive patient experience is our top priority, OU\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Health launched a virtual care program in 2019 in OU Health Physicians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t clinics called\\nOU Health Connect\\n. The program allows providers to engage with patients across the state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t and adjacent states in order to manage medical conditions and appropriately\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t prescribe medications. Services initially included post-operative visits\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t and pain management, and continue to expand in response to patient needs.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t These elements were particularly strategic as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t across the United States.\\nQuality and Patient Safety\\nMIPS/MU/CPC +/Quality\\nOU Health Physicians in Oklahoma City and Tulsa participate in the Merit-based\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Incentive Payment System (MIPS), Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t another program of NCQA that aligns with PCMH, and Meaningful Use (MU),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t which bolsters technology to ensure more broad access to electronic health\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t records, electronic prescribing and other necessary exchanges of health\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t information.\\nOur quality metrics promote transparency throughout the clinical practice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t and contribute to a body of data for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Technologies. These measures are part of a national initiative to improve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t healthcare delivery and infrastructure. In Oklahoma City and Tulsa, dedicated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Quality Managers oversee these areas of clinical operations.\\nAs part of a fully integrated academic healthcare system, OU Health Physicians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t provides unique insight and perspective, using project management approaches\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t to develop, implement and oversee programs and evaluate results.\\nPatient-Centered Medical Home\\nOU Health Physicians primary care clinics in Tulsa and Oklahoma City have earned\\nPatient-Centered Medical Home\\ndesignation, a distinction awarded by the National Committee for Quality\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Assurance (NCQA). Having earned this designation, clinical practices maintain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t NCQA standards of compliance for the most timely and appropriate care.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Participation in the program demonstrates commitment to positive patient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t experience and improved patient care for better overall health status.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Four OU Health Physicians clinics in Tulsa have earned PCMH designation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t In Oklahoma City, more than a dozen OU Health Physicians clinics are PCMH-designated.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Studies show that patients who use PCMH clinics are more likely to stay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t healthy because they take advantage of preventive services and screening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t opportunities that alert them to potential health concerns.\\nWhen you choose OU Health Physicians, you get more than a clinic. You get\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t a medical home – a special place with your own doctor and medical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t team who will help you achieve your best health possible, provide answers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t and guidance and help you stay on top of all your health care needs through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t evidence-based care.\\nThe focus of the patient-centered medical home model is preventive and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t proactive healthcare, which builds patient-provider relationships that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t improve patient outcomes. A team approach ensures comprehensive, coordinated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t care that addresses the total health needs of the individual, rather than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t treating incidental health episodes as they arise.\\nCommunication is a core concept of the patient-centered medical home. Communication\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t encompasses not only the exchange of information between patients, families\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t and caregivers, but also include ease of access to medical records. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t result is better management of chronic or complex conditions.\\nAll of these elements not only contribute to better long-term health outcomes,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t but also create a more positive patient experience. It’s the kind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t of care patients say they value and want to receive.\\nExperts in Complex & Specialty Care\\nChildren are not small adults.

By adopting innovative approaches, OU Health continues to set new standards in patient care and treatment options.\\nOne such advancement is ClearPoint Neuro, Inc.'s\\nSmartFrame OR™\\nplatform, which revolutionizes Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgeries. DBS is a surgical procedure that involves implanting a neurostimulator in the brain to deliver electrical impulses, benefiting patients with movement disorders and certain other neurological conditions. The new technology enables best-in-class accurate electrode placement in the brain while patients are asleep, resulting in faster, more accurate procedures that reduce patient anxiety.\\n“SmartFrame OR represents a paradigm shift for DBS surgeries,” said OU Health neurosurgeon\\nDr. Andrew Conner, M.D.\\n, assistant professor in the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine. Dr. Conner was among the first surgeons to use the device during the FDA Usability Study. OU Health is the first health system in the world to adopt the platform.\\n“This new technology represents a leap forward for DBS surgery. It offers incredibly accurate, consistent, and reliable results. It is truly a game-changer,” Dr. Conner said.\\nMovement disorders affect approximately 42 million people in the United. States. These disorders include conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and others. Common treatments for movement disorders typically involve medications to manage symptoms, physical and occupational therapy, botulinum toxin injections, and surgical options like DBS.\\nTraditionally, patients undergoing a DBS procedure can only be asleep if the procedure is done in an MRI machine; however, due to safety concerns, patients with pacemakers or other such medical devices are unable to undergo the procedure in an MRI environment. For example, pacemakers could heat within the MRI machine, and if the patient is asleep, they are unable to communicate any potentially dangerous discomfort to the surgeons; thus, the procedure must be performed in the operating room.\\nHowever, the accuracy isn’t as fine-tuned as an MRI machine when performing this procedure in the operating room, because it relies on equipment that must be frequently re-calibrated and specially maintained.\\nWith the introduction of SmartFrame OR, OU Health now offers patients the option of undergoing best-in-class accurate electrode placement in the brain in the OR while comfortably asleep.\\nSmartFrame OR is a stereotactic platform featuring a disposable, temporary mount on the skull that facilitates precise electrode placement with best-in-class accuracy. This innovation not only integrates advanced imaging tools for real-time visualization, but also automates adjustments, reducing the need for repeat scans and optimizing patient care during surgery. Furthermore, each platform does not require specialized maintenance and frequent calibration, resulting in consistent and reliable accuracy in every case.\\nThe new SmartFrame OR platform seamlessly integrates with MRI and CT technology, directly in the operating room with high quality precision. This integration and increased accuracy eliminates the previous necessity for awake procedures in the OR providing patients a safer more efficient, and less anxiety-inducing surgical option.\\n“OU Health's adoption of SmartFrame puts us on the global map,” said Dr. Conner. “We're proud to lead the way in patient-centered innovation.\\nRelated Blogs\\nFirst Pediatric Heart Transplant Performed at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health in Decades\\nFeatured, News\\nContinue Reading\\nBreakthrough Type 1 Diabetes Drug Now Offered at OU Health\\nNews\\nContinue Reading\\nOvercoming Glioblastoma: Matt’s Path to Recovery and Research\\nNeurosciences\\nContinue Reading\\nFeatured Blogs\\nFrom Struggle to Strength: Ross’s ...\\nFeatured, Children\\nSara and Jon Helms found out they were expecting their first baby during a particularly busy and stressful period in their lives.

After five months of continuing pain despite chiropractic visits, Jan went to see her doctor. Because of where the pain radiated from, her doctor thought that maybe Jan had damaged her liver in the crash. The news she received could not have been more shocking—Jan had Stage 4 metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer. And if that news wasn’t shocking enough, Jan was given 12 months to live.\\nUterine Carcinosarcoma\\nStage 4 metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma is a type of uterine cancer that has spread beyond the pelvis to other parts of the body. Jan had a tumor on the surface of her liver/diaphragm, and she was having trouble breathing.\\nThe overall 5-year survival for uterine carcinosarcoma is around 20-35% for Stage 3, and the 5-year survival for Stage 4 disease is reported to be around 10%. Uterine carcinosarcomas begin in the lining of the uterus and more than 95% of uterine cancers are carcinomas.\\nIn February 2021, Jan traveled to Texas for surgery, which included a hysterectomy and the removal of other non-vital organs to eliminate the tumors.Following surgery, she started a clinical trial called DUO-E, which involved a combination of treatments:\\nCarboplatin and Paclitaxel\\n: These are the standard of care chemotherapy drugs used to treat endometrial cancer.\\nDurvalumab (IO)\\n: An immunotherapy drug that helps the immune system fight cancer.\\nOlaparib\\n: P PARP inhibitor which targets how cells repair DNA.\\nThe trial had different control groups, with some participants receiving a placebo, others receiving durvalumab and a placebo, another group received Olaparib and a placebo, and the final group receiving both durvalumab and Olaparib. This was a double-blind study meaning that neither the doctor nor the patient knew which group the participants were assigned. Jan received both trial drugs.\\nTransferring to Stephenson Cancer Center\\nJan responded well to the drug. Because she lives in Kansas, her doctors in Texas recommended that she transfer to OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center, which was running the same trial. She transferred her care in August 2021 and continued the clinical trial at Stephenson Cancer Center.\\nDespite a positive response to the drug initially, Jan received bad news in September 2022.\\n“I found out that the cancer had returned, three days after my daughter’s wedding,” said Jan. “I’m so grateful that it was after the wedding, as it would have been a lot more somber.”\\nOU Health gynecologic oncologist\\nDr. Debra Richardson, M.D., FACS, FACOG\\n, professor and Chief in the Section of\\nGynecologic Oncology\\nat the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, surgically removed the cancer. After the resection of the cancer the area received radiation therapy and Jan started chemotherapy with gynecologic oncologist\\nDr. Kathleen Moore, M.D., M.S.\\n, associate director of Clinical Research at Stephenson Cancer Center and professor in the Section of Gynecologic Oncology at OU College of Medicine.\\nThe standard medications for Jan’s treatment included Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab. Lenvatinib works by blocking the growth of cancer cells and cutting off the blood supply that tumors need to grow. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy drug that helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. This combination has a high response rate in recurrent endometrial cancer. However, because Jan had significant side effects, Dr. Moore recommended she try something else, even though the medications were working against the cancer.\\nPhase 1 Clinical Trials\\nThere was no way that Jan was ready to give up. In September 2023, she was enrolled in a Phase 1 clinical trial for a new drug called DB-1303, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADC is a special kind of cancer treatment that combines an antibody and a chemotherapy drug.\\nThe antibody part of DB-1303 searches for a specific protein called HER2neu, found on the surface of some cancer cells. The antibody binds to cancer cells that express HER2neu, the cell internalizes the drug and releases the chemotherapy inside the cancer cell, killing it.\\nBy delivering the chemotherapy drug directly to the cancer cell, DB-1303 helps to kill the cancer cells more effectively. This targeted approach also helps to reduce damage to healthy cells, which can minimize side effects.\\nBy participating in this trial, Jan is not only given access to new drugs before they reach the market, but she is also helping researchers learn more about DB-1303 and its potential to treat HER2-positive cancers. This could lead to new and better treatment options for people with this type of cancer in the future.\\nOutstanding Results\\nJan responded extremely well to DB-1303 with no side effects and a year later, at 71 years old, she has no detectable cancer.\\n“I couldn’t be more thrilled that Jan is thriving on this clinical trial,” said Dr. Richardson. “She has a complete response, which means we cannot detect any evidence of cancer on imaging or physical exam, and she has no cancer symptoms. This is always our goal when treating cancer.”\\nWith such a fantastic response to the clinical trial, Jan will stay on the drug for the foreseeable future.\\n“The carcinosarcoma is very aggressive so I’ll stay on the medication and just keep doing what we’re doing,” said Jan. “I was given 12 months to live and here I am three years later. I was able to see my daughter get married, my son get sober, and my daughter give me a grandson. I feel I have a future now.”\\nCancer clinical trials are research studies aimed at discovering new methods for diagnosing, treating, and managing cancer. These trials involve volunteers, both cancer patients and healthy individuals, to evaluate new treatments or innovative uses of existing ones. Stephenson Cancer Center stands out as the only facility in Oklahoma offering Phase I clinical trials.\\n“OU Health researchers work on new medical solutions every day. For many of us, trial drugs give us an alternative when we’re not responding to traditional treatment,” said Jan. “It’s so important that we participate in new drug testing. If you have the need, go to Stephenson Cancer Center. My experience has been great.”\\nWhile you wait for a diagnosis, seek a second opinion, or consider transferring care for yourself or a loved one, you can count on the expert teams at OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center to support you from diagnosis through survivorship.\\nComplete this form\\nor give us a call at\\n(405) 271-1112\\nto request an appointment.\\nRelated Blogs\\nSigns to Visit Urgent Care or the ER for a Cough\\nBlog\\nContinue Reading\\nComplex Spinal Surgery for a Rare Growth Disorder — Carissah’s Story\\nBlog\\nContinue Reading\\nOvercoming Glioblastoma: Matt’s Path to Recovery and Research\\nBlog\\nContinue Reading\\nFeatured Blogs\\nFrom Struggle to Strength: Ross’s ...\\nFeatured, Children\\nSara and Jon Helms found out they were expecting their first baby during a particularly busy and stressful period in their lives.

In 2019 alone, OU Health provided $115\\n\\t million in charity care for uninsured patients and unreimbursed services.\\n\\t OU Health also serves a disproportionate number of underserved communities,\\n\\t including older adults and children from low-income families. Often relying\\n\\t on government payors, more than 60% of our patients have highly complex\\n\\t health needs. The variety of our patients and our services aligns with\\n\\t the principles of our mission: patient care, education and research to\\n\\t improve the lives of all people.\\nBeyond the Doctor’s Office\\nHealthy living happens every day – through actions you can take to\\n\\t prevent certain health conditions, regular checkups that keep you on track\\n\\t and easy access to specialty care when you need it. OU Health stands by\\n\\t your side at every step along your health journey with the many ways we\\n\\t make sound investments in our community through services and programs\\n\\t that reach far beyond the doors of our facilities.\\nInnovative Research for Improving Community Health\\nIn partnership with University of Oklahoma Centers of Excellence, OU Health\\n\\t supports innovative research intended to improve quality of life in the\\n\\t state. Whether working with the OU Tulsa campus on the Food Is Medicine\\n\\t program and study, supporting the development of smoking cessation technologies\\n\\t or actively participating in the Oklahoma Physicians Research/Resource\\n\\t Network (OKPRN), OU Health invests in innovation happening throughout Oklahoma.\\nEducation for Health Professionals\\nAs Oklahoma’s only comprehensive academic medical center and campus,\\n\\t OU Health serves a critical role in developing the next generation of\\n\\t medical professionals for the state and region. The leading healthcare\\n\\t experts in many medical fields work at OU Health, serving our community\\n\\t and training the strongest possible healthcare workforce for Oklahoma’s future.\\nActivities to Improve Community Health\\nWhile medical professionals across OU Health primarily focus on providing\\n\\t the highest quality healthcare, OU Health staff members at all levels\\n\\t give their time to help make Oklahoma a better, healthier place to live.\\n\\t You’ll find OU Health staff as volunteers in the community through\\n\\t efforts like our\\nLive to Give program\\n, as well as investing in community-based organizations and strategically\\n\\t connecting with partners throughout the community. All activities seek\\n\\t to improve both quality of life and health outcomes for communities we serve.\\nStrategic Efforts in Community Health\\nFor information about the strategic vision and goals of OU Health community\\n\\t health efforts, watch here for updates via our annual report.\\nCommunity Health Needs Assessment\\nBy understanding what’s happening in our communities and completing\\n\\t a thorough examination of health needs, we can more strategically target\\n\\t efforts and programs to create stronger impacts.\\nReview the\\nCommunity Health Needs Assessment Report [pdf]\\nto find out more.\\nCommitment to Good Stewardship\\nThrough the\\n340B Good Stewardship Program [pdf] ,\\nOU Health better serves the community by extending its resources to the\\n\\t benefit of communities across the region.\\nOU Health in the Community\\nCommunity Health Improvement Activities\\nOklahoma City Public Schools Partnership\\n340B Good Stewardship Program\\nAnnual Community Health Reports\\nDiscover what patient-centered care means for you\\nLearn More\\nI want to...\\nView All OU Health Services\\nLog In To Patient Portal\\nRequest Medical Records\\nSend a Greeting\\nSearch eHealth Library\\n700 NE 13th St\\nOklahoma City\\n,\\nOK\\n73104\\nMap + Directions\\nFor Hospital Information:\\n(405) 271-4700\\nFor appointments:\\n(405) 271-2222\\nAbout OU Health\\nBilling & Insurance\\nCalendar & Events\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nCOVID-19 Services & Treatments\\neHealth Library\\nMedical Records\\nNewsroom & Media\\nNotice of Privacy Practices\\nOU Health in the Community\\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\\nPhysician Access & Logins\\nPrice Transparency\\nVendor Registration & Login\\nWays to Give\\nx\\n⚠\\nYour browser is out of date.

He has spent about 300 days in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit of Oklahoma Children’s Hospital awaiting a new heart. He was born in December 2023 in Tulsa and quickly airlifted to Oklahoma’s Children’s Hospital and added to the transplant list in March 2024.\\nParker’s parents, Faith and David, shared their joy with a simple phrase, “There’s an angel in heaven who left their heart for me.”\\nThe achievement means Oklahoma children and their families no longer need to leave the state for this life-saving care. An estimated five children a year in Oklahoma have had to leave the state for transplants over the past decade.\\n“With a successful pediatric heart transplant in Oklahoma, this is the final step in ensuring that the children of Oklahoma have access to all cardiac care without having to leave the state,” said pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon\\nDr. Harold Burkhart, M.D.\\n, professor of surgery and Chief of the Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine and director of the Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgical Program at Oklahoma Children\\'s Hospital. “This incredibly important milestone is 10 years in the making, and I am deeply honored and immensely proud of our team’s life-saving efforts.\"\\nOklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health joins an elite list of approximately 65 health systems offering this highly specialized pediatric surgical care for children. The team includes experienced pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiologists and advanced practice providers who utilize the latest treatment protocols and advanced techniques. Their work, including participation in clinical trials, has led to significant medical breakthroughs in pediatric cardiac care.\\nFor the Helmerichs, it meant they were able to remain close to home as Parker awaited life-saving surgery. He will be able to continue to receive follow-up care close to home, surrounded by family, and begin his recovery process and ongoing care.\\nIn February 2024, Oklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health Heart Center\\nlisted its first pediatric patient for a donor heart\\nwith the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), marking a significant milestone in pediatric cardiac care for the state and region. This breakthrough revives Oklahoma’s pediatric heart transplant program, dormant since the 1990s. As the state’s sole pediatric heart transplant center, the Heart Center is a vital hub for advanced cardiac care, serving children across Oklahoma and beyond.\\nIn preparation for the new transplant program, Oklahoma Children\\'s Hospital opened the state\\'s only 25-bed pediatric cardiac intensive care unit in 2022, dedicated exclusively to children with heart conditions, including transplant patients.\\n“Oklahoma now boasts a fully comprehensive pediatric heart transplant center, enabling us to deliver the highest level of coordinated care for our young transplant patients,” said pediatric cardiologist\\nDr. R Erik Edens, M.D., Ph.D.\\n“This program bridges the final gap in treating pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. This first successful pediatric heart transplant is just another step in ensuring our youngest patients can receive top-tier heart care right here at home.”\\n\\u200b\\nDr. Burkhart moved to Oklahoma in 2014 to build the pediatric cardiac surgery program at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital. The pediatric cardiac surgery team at Oklahoma Children\\'s Hospital now performs more than 500 surgeries annually, with a 98.8% survival rate for open-heart surgery — above the national average regardless of complexity.\\nU.S. News & World Report has recognized the program as a Top 50 Best Children’s Hospitals in the nation for Pediatric Cardiology & Heart Surgery for its 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 rankings. In addition, Oklahoma Children’s Hospital received the 2021 Mended Hearts International, Regional, Divisional, and National Hospital of the Year awards.\\n“Our mission at OU Health is to be the premier destination for Oklahomans facing severe and life-threatening conditions, leveraging our academic environment and expert teams equipped with advanced technology and knowledge,” said\\nDr. Richard Lofgren, M.D., MPH\\n, president and CEO of OU Health. “When it comes to children, no parent wants to face an away game for their children’s healthcare and this major milestone for our team is another step forward in keeping Oklahoma’s kids here in Oklahoma for the advanced care they need.”\\n\\u200b\\nEach year, approximately 450 pediatric heart transplants are performed in the United States. Heart failure in children can result from cardiomyopathy, congenital heart defects or other medical conditions that damage the heart. Regardless of the cause, children with severe heart issues may require a heart transplant to survive.\\nChildren with congenital heart disease often undergo one to three open-heart surgeries before receiving a transplant. A heart transplant can significantly extend and improve their lives.

Key areas of research include cancer, diabetes,\\n\\t neuroscience and vision, and infectious diseases and immunology.\\nTypes of Research\\nThe academic specialists and researchers at OU Health perform several types\\n\\t of research with the overarching goal to help people of all ages who live\\n\\t with or experience a variety of health conditions.\\nBasic Science Research\\nIn basic science research, usually conducted in a laboratory, scientists\\n\\t seek to improve our understanding of how the human body works when it’s\\n\\t well and when it’s sick. Basic science research studies may examine:\\nThe role of a protein that triggers cachexia, a muscle-wasting condition\\n\\t\\t\\t that occurs in 80% of people who have pancreatic cancer.\\nBacteria that seeps into microscopic cracks of a tooth cavity filling and\\n\\t\\t\\t ways to improve the adhesive resin of the filling to attack the bacteria.\\nWhat role inflammation plays in both aging and age-related diseases like cancer.\\nTranslational Research\\nTranslational research takes discoveries made in basic science laboratories\\n\\t and investigates ways to translate them into actual treatments for patients.\\n\\t Often described as moving from “the bench to the bedside,”\\n\\t translational research looks for ways to transform research and move it\\n\\t from the laboratory bench to the patient’s bedside. In this approach,\\n\\t a researcher may:\\nCollaborate with a biotechnology company to discover targets that will\\n\\t\\t\\t help the body’s immune system find and kill cells infected with\\n\\t\\t\\t the COVID-19 virus. The research outcomes would then be used to develop\\n\\t\\t\\t a vaccine for COVID-19.\\nDevelop a compound that’s been shown in the laboratory to prevent\\n\\t\\t\\t formation of ovarian cancer tumors without side effects. The drug is now\\n\\t\\t\\t being tested in humans in a clinical trial.\\nDiscover the biological root of unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms.\\n\\t\\t\\t The discovery has been translated into a panel of tests now used around\\n\\t\\t\\t the world to diagnose neuropsychiatric disorders in children.\\nClinical Research & Clinical Trials\\nClinical research focuses on specific solutions and examines how they function\\n\\t in humans. Clinical research often takes the form of clinical trials –\\n\\t studies performed in humans to determine whether new drugs and other therapies\\n\\t are safe and effective for specific diseases. Through OU Health’s\\n\\t facilities like Stephenson Cancer Center, Oklahoma’s only National\\n\\t Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, you can receive the newest\\n\\t and most innovative treatments available through clinical trials and gain\\n\\t access to the state’s only\\nPhase I clinical trials\\nprogram.\\nAt OU Health, clinical research explores a wide range of topics and may\\n\\t include a variety of specific projects. For example:\\nA cardiologist studies the effectiveness of a non-invasive stimulation\\n\\t\\t\\t of the vagus nerve to regulate the abnormal heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation.\\n\\t\\t\\t A small device connected to a person’s ear delivers a low-level\\n\\t\\t\\t electrical stimulation to the nerve.\\nA pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon treats babies born with hypoplastic\\n\\t\\t\\t left heart syndrome (HLHS) and studies the effectiveness of injecting\\n\\t\\t\\t the baby’s umbilical cord blood cells directly into the heart to\\n\\t\\t\\t improve heart function.\\nA clinical trial studies the effectiveness of a drug for women with ovarian\\n\\t\\t\\t cancer who have undergone four or more rounds of chemotherapy.\\nHow Academic Medical Research Benefits You\\nBringing advanced research directly to the healthcare services you receive\\n\\t makes OU Health different from other healthcare systems in Oklahoma and\\n\\t across the region. When you and your family work with the experts and\\n\\t specialists at OU Health, part of your care happens at our Oklahoma City\\n\\t campus, home to the largest and most advanced biomedical infrastructure\\n\\t in Oklahoma and the researchers who receive awards of millions of dollars\\n\\t in state and federal grants annually. Those resources provide momentum\\n\\t for our healthcare commitment – to improve the quality of life for\\n\\t you and your loved ones and to discover new methods for preventing, treating\\n\\t and curing diseases we all face.\\nLearn More\\nDiscover how OU Health scientists decipher the mysteries of human disease\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t that hold great promise for innovations to improve your health and well-being.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Learn more about research at the\\nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.\\nResearch & Innovation\\nClinical Trials at OU Health\\nSee how you benefit from OU Health services in the community\\nLearn More\\nDiscover what patient-centered care means for you\\nLearn More\\nI want to...\\nView All OU Health Services\\nLog In To Patient Portal\\nRequest Medical Records\\nSend a Greeting\\nSearch eHealth Library\\n700 NE 13th St\\nOklahoma City\\n,\\nOK\\n73104\\nMap + Directions\\nFor Hospital Information:\\n(405) 271-4700\\nFor appointments:\\n(405) 271-2222\\nAbout OU Health\\nBilling & Insurance\\nCalendar & Events\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nCOVID-19 Services & Treatments\\neHealth Library\\nMedical Records\\nNewsroom & Media\\nNotice of Privacy Practices\\nOU Health in the Community\\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\\nPhysician Access & Logins\\nPrice Transparency\\nVendor Registration & Login\\nWays to Give\\nx\\n⚠\\nYour browser is out of date.

And a good person to start with is your healthcare provider.\\n\\t Once you have made your decisions and plans, share them with family members\\n\\t and other care providers.\\nWhat is Advance Care Planning and Why Is It Important?\\nAdvance Care Planning is the process of making decisions in advance of\\n an illness or injury to express your choices if you became unable to communicate\\n those choices yourself. Many people do not think about planning for their\\n end-of-life care until they are older or very sick. However, anyone over\\n the age of 18 should make a plan in case of a serious disease, accident,\\n or sudden emergency such as surgery while able to do so. Oklahoma law\\n assumes that persons want all possible treatment to keep them alive unless\\n a completed Advance Directive Form states otherwise.\\nWhy Do I Need Advance Care Planning?\\nNot only will planning for your care give you peace of mind, it will lessen\\n the suffering of your loved ones. Without a written plan, you would receive\\n all necessary medical treatment in the event you suddenly became sick\\n or injured. If you were unable to speak for yourself, doctors would not\\n know your wishes and your loved ones might be scared, overwhelmed, or\\n unsure of what to do. You might already have strong beliefs about:\\nWho you would like to make health care decisions for you.\\nWhat treatments you would agree to or refuse in order to keep you alive.\\nWhere you choose to spend the last days of your life.\\nFinancial costs for treatments that may keep you alive but not make you better.\\nWhat is an Advance Directive?\\nAn Advance Directive form is a legal document that allows you to write\\n down your wishes for healthcare treatment during the end-stage of your\\n life. This form will also allow you to appoint someone to be your voice\\n (Health Care Proxy) if you are unable to speak for yourself. It is important\\n to know that this form only becomes valid if two doctors have determined\\n that you are unable to make medical decisions.\\nAn Advance Directive Allows You To:\\nChoose a person to make health care choices for you. You can also choose\\n\\t\\t an alternate\\n(back-up) person in the event your first choice is unable to speak for you.\\nIndicate what health care treatments you would agree to or refuse.\\nChoose if you would like to accept or refuse life support for certain conditions.\\nIndicate if you would like to donate your body or organs for medical research\\n\\t\\t or people waiting\\non transplant.\\nCheck your knowledge of advanced directives with this quiz\\n.\\nDownload and refer to the document below.\\nOU Health Patients & Families\\nPatient Portals\\nOU Health MyChart FAQs\\nVideo Visit Support\\nSchedule Your Appointment\\nHospital Charges, Pricing & Transparency\\nRequest Medical Records\\nRequest Medical Records - OU Health Physicians Tulsa\\nInsurance & Billing\\nInsurance - OU Health Physicians\\nInsurance - OU Health Hospitals & ERs\\nBilling - OU Health Physicians\\nBilling - OU Health Hospitals & ERs\\nFinancial Assistance Programs\\nNo Surprises Act\\nOnline Bill Pay\\nInsurance - SoonerSelect\\nPet Therapy\\nSpiritual Care\\nAdvanced Care Planning for Medical Decisions\\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\\nHealth Care Equality\\nNotice of Privacy Practices\\neHealth Library\\nSend a Greeting\\nDAISY Award Nomination\\nAbout OU Health\\nAbout OU Health Physicians\\nSee how you benefit from OU Health services in the community\\nLearn More\\nDiscover what patient-centered care means for you\\nLearn More\\nI want to...\\nView All OU Health Services\\nLog In To Patient Portal\\nRequest Medical Records\\nSend a Greeting\\nSearch eHealth Library\\n700 NE 13th St\\nOklahoma City\\n,\\nOK\\n73104\\nMap + Directions\\nFor Hospital Information:\\n(405) 271-4700\\nFor appointments:\\n(405) 271-2222\\nAbout OU Health\\nBilling & Insurance\\nCalendar & Events\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nCOVID-19 Services & Treatments\\neHealth Library\\nMedical Records\\nNewsroom & Media\\nNotice of Privacy Practices\\nOU Health in the Community\\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\\nPhysician Access & Logins\\nPrice Transparency\\nVendor Registration & Login\\nWays to Give\\nx\\n⚠\\nYour browser is out of date.

It applies to the health\\n\\t information that is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and\\n\\t Accountability Act (HIPAA). Used to make decisions about your care, and\\n\\t generated or maintained by OU Health (OUH). Please review it carefully.\\nIf you have any questions about this notice, please contact Amber Simpson,\\n\\t the Facility Privacy Official by dialing (405) 271-5920.\\nEach time you visit a hospital, physician, or other healthcare provider,\\n\\t a record of your visit is made. Typically, this record contains your symptoms,\\n\\t examination and test results, diagnoses, treatment, a plan for future\\n\\t care or treatment, and billing-related information. This notice applies\\n\\t to all of the records of your care generated by the facility, whether\\n\\t made by facility personnel, agents of the facility, or your personal doctor.\\n\\t Your personal doctor may have different policies or notices regarding\\n\\t the doctor’s use and disclosure of your health information created\\n\\t in the doctor’s office or clinic.\\nOur Responsibilities:\\nWe are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information,\\n\\t provide you a description of our privacy practices, and to notify you\\n\\t following a breach of unsecured protected health information. We will\\n\\t abide by the terms of this notice.\\nUses and Disclosures\\nHow we may use and disclose Health Information about you.\\nThe following categories describe examples of the way we use and disclose\\n\\t health information:\\nFor Treatment:\\nWe may use health information about you to provide you treatment or services.\\n\\t We may disclose health information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians,\\n\\t medical students, or other facility personnel who are involved in taking\\n\\t care of you at the facility. For example: a doctor treating you for a\\n\\t broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may\\n\\t slow the healing process. Different departments of the facility also may\\n\\t share health information about you in order to coordinate the different\\n\\t things you may need, such as prescriptions, lab work, meals, and x-rays.\\nWe may also provide your physician or a subsequent healthcare provider\\n\\t with copies of various reports that should assist him or her in treating\\n\\t you once you’re discharged from this facility.\\nFor Payment:\\nWe may use and disclose health information about your treatment and services\\n\\t to bill and collect payment from you, your insurance company or a third\\n\\t party payer. For example, we may need to give your insurance company information\\n\\t about your surgery so they will pay us or reimburse you for the treatment.\\n\\t We may also tell your health plan about treatment you are going to receive\\n\\t to determine whether your plan will cover it. We may release your information\\n\\t to a collection agency if your account is not paid.\\nFor Health Care Operations:\\nMembers of the medical staff and/or quality improvement team may use information\\n\\t in your health record to assess the care and outcomes in your case and\\n\\t others like it. The results will then be used to continually improve the\\n\\t quality of care for all patients we serve. For example, we may combine\\n\\t health information about many patients to evaluate the need for new services\\n\\t or treatment. We may disclose information to doctors, nurses, and other\\n\\t students for educational purposes. And we may combine health information\\n\\t we have with that of other facilities to see where we can make improvements.\\n\\t We may remove information that identifies you from this set of health\\n\\t information to protect your privacy.\\nFundraising\\n: We may contact you to raise funds for the facility; however, you have\\n\\t the right to elect not to receive such communications.\\nWe may also use and disclose health information:\\nTo remind you that you have an appointment for medical care;\\nTo assess your satisfaction with our services;\\nTo tell you about possible treatment alternatives;\\nTo tell you about health–related benefits or services;\\nFor population based activities relating to improving health or reducing\\n\\t\\t health care costs;\\nFor conducting training programs or reviewing competence of health care\\n\\t\\t professionals; and\\nTo a Medicaid eligibility database and the Children’s Health Insurance\\n\\t\\t Program eligibility database, as applicable.\\nWhen disclosing information, primarily appointment reminders and billing/collections\\n\\t efforts, we may leave messages on your answering machine/voice mail.\\nBusiness Associates:\\nThere are some services provided in our organization through contracts\\n\\t with business associates. Examples include physician services in the emergency\\n\\t department and radiology, certain laboratory tests, and a copy service\\n\\t we use when making copies of your health record. When these services are\\n\\t contracted, we may disclose your health information to our business associates\\n\\t so that they can perform the job we’ve asked them to do and bill\\n\\t you or your third-party payer for services rendered. To protect your health\\n\\t information, however, business associates are required by federal law\\n\\t to appropriately safeguard your information.\\nDirectory:\\nWe may include certain limited information about you in the facility directory\\n\\t while you are a patient at the facility. The information may include your\\n\\t name, location in the facility, your general condition (\\ne.g\\n., good, fair) and your religious affiliation. This information may be\\n\\t provided to members of the clergy and, except for religious affiliation,\\n\\t to other people who ask for you by name. If you would like to opt out\\n\\t of being in the facility directory please request the Opt Out Form from\\n\\t the admission staff or Facility Privacy Official.\\nIndividuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care and/or Notification Purposes:\\nWe may release health information about you to a friend or family member\\n\\t who is involved in your medical care or who helps pay for your care or\\n\\t to notify, or assist in the notification of (including identifying or\\n\\t locating), a family member, your personal representative, or another person\\n\\t responsible for your care of your location and general condition. In addition,\\n\\t we may disclose health information about you to an entity assisting in\\n\\t a disaster relief effort in order to assist with the provision of this notice.\\nResearch:\\nThe use of health information is important to develop new knowledge and\\n\\t improve medical care. We may use or disclose health information for research\\n\\t studies but only when they meet all federal and state requirements to\\n\\t protect your privacy (such as using only de-identified data whenever possible).\\n\\t You may also be contacted to participate in a research study.\\nFuture Communications:\\nWe may communicate to you via newsletters, mail outs or other means regarding\\n\\t treatment options, health related information, disease-management programs,\\n\\t wellness programs, research projects, or other community based initiatives\\n\\t or activities our facility is participating in.\\nOrganized Health Care Arrangement:\\nThis facility and its medical staff members have organized and are presenting\\n\\t you this document as a joint notice. Information will be shared as necessary\\n\\t to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations. Physicians\\n\\t and caregivers may have access to protected health information in their\\n\\t offices to assist in reviewing past treatment as it may affect treatment\\n\\t at the time.\\nAffiliated Covered Entity:\\nProtected health information will be made available to facility personnel\\n\\t at local affiliated facilities as necessary to carry out treatment, payment\\n\\t and health care operations. Caregivers at other facilities may have access\\n\\t to protected health information at their locations to assist in reviewing\\n\\t past treatment information as it may affect treatment at this time. Please\\n\\t contact the Facility Privacy Official for further information on the specific\\n\\t sites included in this affiliated covered entity.\\nHealth Information Exchange/Regional Health Information Organization\\n: Federal and state laws may permit us to participate in organizations\\n\\t with other healthcare providers, insurers, and/or other health care industry\\n\\t participants and their subcontractors in order for these individuals and\\n\\t entities to share your health information with one another to accomplish\\n\\t goals that may include but not be limited to: improving the accuracy and\\n\\t increasing the availability of your health records; decreasing the time\\n\\t needed to access your information; aggregating and comparing your information\\n\\t for quality improvement purposes; and such other purposes as may be permitted by law.\\nAs required by law.\\nWe may disclose information when required to do so by law.\\nAs permitted by law\\n, we may also use and disclose health information for the following types\\n\\t of entities, including but not limited to:\\nFood and Drug Administration\\nPublic Health or Legal Authorities charged with preventing or controlling\\n\\t\\t disease, injury or disability\\nCorrectional Institutions\\nWorkers Compensation Agents\\nOrgan and Tissue Donation Organizations\\nMilitary Command Authorities\\nHealth Oversight Agencies\\nFuneral Directors and Coroners\\nNational Security and Intelligence Agencies\\nProtective Services for the President and Others\\nA person or persons able to prevent or lessen a serious threat to health or safety\\nLaw Enforcement:\\nWe may disclose health information to a law enforcement official for purposes\\n\\t such as providing limited information to locate a missing person or report a crime.\\nFor Judicial or Administrative Proceedings\\n: We may disclose protected health information as permitted by law in connection\\n\\t with judicial or administrative proceedings, such as in response to a\\n\\t court order, search warrant or subpoena.\\nAuthorization Required:\\nWe must obtain your written authorization in order to use or disclose psychotherapy\\n\\t notes, use or disclose your protected health information for marketing\\n\\t purposes, or to sell your protected health information.\\nState-Specific Requirements:\\nMany states have requirements for reporting including population-based\\n\\t activities relating to improving health or reducing health care costs.\\n\\t Some states have separate privacy laws that may apply additional legal\\n\\t requirements. If the state privacy laws are more stringent than federal\\n\\t privacy laws, the state law preempts the federal law.\\nYour Health Information Rights\\nAlthough your health record is the physical property of the healthcare\\n\\t practitioner or facility that compiled it, you have the\\nRight to\\n:\\nInspect and Copy\\n:\\nYou have the right to inspect and obtain a copy of the health information\\n\\t\\t that may be used to make decisions about your care. Usually, this includes\\n\\t\\t medical and billing records, but does not include psychotherapy notes.\\n\\t\\t We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain very limited circumstances.\\n\\t\\t If you are denied access to health information, you may request that the\\n\\t\\t denial be reviewed.

You also have the right to request a limit on the health\\n\\t\\t information we disclose about you to someone who is involved in your care\\n\\t\\t or the payment for your care, like a family member or friend.

Este aviso aplica para todos\\n\\t los expedientes que se generen en el centro, ya sean generados por el\\n\\t personal del centro, los representantes del mismo o su médico personal.\\n\\t Su médico personal podría tener políticas o avisos\\n\\t diferentes con respecto al uso y divulgación que el médico\\n\\t haga de su información médica generada en el consultorio\\n\\t o clínica del médico.\\nNuestras responsabilidades:\\nNos encontramos obligados por ley a mantener la privacidad de su información\\n\\t médica, proporcionarle una descripción de nuestras prácticas\\n\\t de privacidad y de notificarle en caso de que ocurra una violación\\n\\t a la información médica protegida que no esté garantizada.\\n\\t Nosotros cumpliremos con los términos de este aviso.\\nUsos y divulgaciones:\\nCómo podemos usar y divulgar información médica sobre usted.\\nLas siguientes categorías describen ejemplos de las formas en las\\n\\t que usamos y divulgamos la información médica:\\nPara tratamiento:\\nNosotros podemos usar información médica sobre usted para\\n\\t proporcionarle tratamientos o servicios. Nosotros podremos divulgar información\\n\\t médica sobre usted a médicos, enfermeras(os), personal técnico,\\n\\t estudiantes de medicina u otros integrantes del personal del centro que\\n\\t participen en su atención en el centro. Por ejemplo: es posible\\n\\t que un médico que lo atienda por una pierna rota necesite saber\\n\\t si tiene diabetes, porque esta enfermedad puede hacer que el proceso de\\n\\t curación sea más lento. Diferentes departamentos de este\\n\\t centro también pueden compartir información médica\\n\\t sobre usted con la finalidad de coordinar diferentes cosas que usted pueda\\n\\t necesitar, tales como prescripciones, trabajo de laboratorio, comidas\\n\\t y rayos X.\\nNosotros podremos proporcionar a su médico o a un proveedor de servicios\\n\\t de salud copias de varios reportes que podrían ayudarle a brindar\\n\\t el tratamiento después de que le den de alta en este centro.\\nPara los pagos:\\nNosotros podríamos usar y divulgar la información médica\\n\\t sobre su tratamiento y sus servicios para facturar y cobrar los pagos\\n\\t ya sea a usted, a su aseguradora o a un tercero encargado del pago. Por\\n\\t ejemplo, es posible que necesitemos proporcionar información sobre\\n\\t usted a su aseguradora acerca de su cirugía para que ellos nos\\n\\t paguen o le reembolsen el costo del tratamiento. También podríamos\\n\\t informar a su plan médico acerca del tratamiento que recibirá\\n\\t para determinar si su plan lo cubre o no. Podemos divulgar su información\\n\\t a una agencia de cobranza si su cuenta no está pagada.\\nPara operaciones de atención médica:\\nLos integrantes del personal médico y/o el equipo de mejoramiento\\n\\t de la calidad podrían usar la información en su expediente\\n\\t médico para evaluar la atención y los resultados de su caso\\n\\t y otros similares. Los resultados entonces se utilizarán para el\\n\\t mejoramiento continuo de la calidad de la atención para todos los\\n\\t pacientes que atendemos. Por ejemplo, podríamos combinar la información\\n\\t médica de muchos pacientes para evaluar la necesidad de nuevos\\n\\t servicios o tratamiento. Podríamos divulgar la información\\n\\t a los médicos, las enfermeras o los estudiantes de medicina para\\n\\t fines educativos. Y podríamos combinar la información médica\\n\\t que tenemos con aquella de otros centros para ver en dónde podemos\\n\\t mejorar. Podemos eliminar la información que lo identifique de\\n\\t este conjunto de información médica a fin de proteger su\\n\\t privacidad.\\nRecaudación de fondos:\\nPodríamos comunicarnos con usted para recaudar fondos para el centro;\\n\\t sin embargo, usted tiene el derecho a elegir no recibir tales comunicados.\\nTambién podríamos usar y divulgar la información médica:\\nPara recordarle que tiene una cita para atención médica;\\nPara evaluar su satisfacción con nuestros servicios;\\nPara comentarle acerca de posibles alternativas de tratamiento;\\nPara comentarle acerca de beneficios o servicios relacionados con la salud;\\nPara actividades sociales relacionadas con el mejoramiento de la salud\\n\\t\\t o la reducción de costos de atención médica;\\nPara llevar a cabo programas de capacitación o evaluar la competencia\\n\\t\\t de los profesionales de atención médica; y\\nPara una base de datos de elegibilidad para Medicaid y base de datos de\\n\\t\\t elegibilidad para el Programa de seguro médico para los niños (\\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program\\n), en caso de ser aplicable.\\nAl divulgar información, principalmente recordatorios de citas y\\n\\t actividades de facturación/cobranza, podemos dejar mensajes en\\n\\t su máquina contestadora o buzón de voz.\\nSocios comerciales:\\nExisten algunos servicios que se proporcionan en nuestra organización\\n\\t a través de contratos con Socios comerciales. Como ejemplo están\\n\\t los servicios que proporcionen los médicos en el departamento de\\n\\t urgencias y radiología, determinadas pruebas de laboratorio y un\\n\\t servicio de copias que usamos al realizar copias de su expediente médico.\\n\\t Cuando se contraten estos servicios, podríamos divulgar su información\\n\\t médica a nuestros socios comerciales para que ellos puedan realizar\\n\\t el trabajo que les solicitamos y facturarle a usted o al tercero encargado\\n\\t del pago por los servicios prestados. Sin embargo, para proteger su información\\n\\t médica, los socios comerciales están obligados por ley federal\\n\\t a salvaguardar su información de manera adecuada.\\nDirectorio:\\nPodemos incluir cierta información limitada sobre usted en el directorio\\n\\t del centro mientras usted sea paciente en el mismo. Dicha información\\n\\t puede incluir su nombre, ubicación en el centro, su estado general\\n\\t (p.ej. bueno, estable) y sus afiliaciones religiosas. Esta información\\n\\t puede ser proporcionada a miembros del clero y, excepto por su afiliación\\n\\t religiosa, a otras personas que pregunten por su nombre.

Es posible que se comuniquen con usted para preguntarle\\n\\t si desea participar en un estudio de investigación.\\nComunicados futuros:\\nPodemos comunicarnos con usted por medio de boletines, correos y otros\\n\\t medios con respecto a opciones de tratamiento, información relacionada\\n\\t con la salud, programas para el manejo de enfermedades, programas de bienestar,\\n\\t proyectos de investigación u otras iniciativas o actividades comunitarias\\n\\t en las que participe nuestro centro.\\nAcuerdo de atención médica organizada:\\nEste centro y los integrantes del personal médico han organizado\\n\\t y le presentan este documento a manera de notificación conjunta.\\n\\t La información se compartirá en la medida en que sea necesario\\n\\t para llevar a cabo el tratamiento, los pagos y las operaciones de atención\\n\\t médica. Los médicos y cuidadores pueden tener acceso a la\\n\\t información médica protegida en sus consultorios como material\\n\\t de apoyo para la revisión de tratamientos previos, ya que estos\\n\\t datos podrían afectar el tratamiento actual.\\nEntidad afiliada cubierta:\\nLa información médica protegida estará disponible\\n\\t para el personal del centro en centros locales afiliados en caso de ser\\n\\t necesario para llevar a cabo un tratamiento, pago y operaciones de atención\\n\\t médica. Los cuidadores en otros centros podrán tener acceso\\n\\t a la información médica protegida en sus ubicaciones como\\n\\t material de apoyo para la revisión de los tratamientos previos,\\n\\t ya que estos datos podrían afectar el tratamiento actual.

In connection with this award, OU Health was prominently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t featured in an Amwell publication, which detailed OU Health’s strategic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t implementation of a range of virtual tools for patient care.\\nOU Health Connect\\nBecause ensuring a positive patient experience is our top priority, OU\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Health launched a virtual care program in 2019 in OU Health Physicians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t clinics called\\nOU Health Connect\\n. The program allows providers to engage with patients across the state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t and adjacent states in order to manage medical conditions and appropriately\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t prescribe medications. Services initially included post-operative visits\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t and pain management, and continue to expand in response to patient needs.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t These elements were particularly strategic as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t across the United States.\\nQuality and Patient Safety\\nMIPS/MU/CPC +/Quality\\nOU Health Physicians in Oklahoma City and Tulsa participate in the Merit-based\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Incentive Payment System (MIPS), Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t another program of NCQA that aligns with PCMH, and Meaningful Use (MU),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t which bolsters technology to ensure more broad access to electronic health\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t records, electronic prescribing and other necessary exchanges of health\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t information.\\nOur quality metrics promote transparency throughout the clinical practice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t and contribute to a body of data for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Technologies. These measures are part of a national initiative to improve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t healthcare delivery and infrastructure. In Oklahoma City and Tulsa, dedicated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Quality Managers oversee these areas of clinical operations.\\nAs part of a fully integrated academic healthcare system, OU Health Physicians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t provides unique insight and perspective, using project management approaches\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t to develop, implement and oversee programs and evaluate results.\\nPatient-Centered Medical Home\\nOU Health Physicians primary care clinics in Tulsa and Oklahoma City have earned\\nPatient-Centered Medical Home\\ndesignation, a distinction awarded by the National Committee for Quality\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Assurance (NCQA). Having earned this designation, clinical practices maintain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t NCQA standards of compliance for the most timely and appropriate care.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Participation in the program demonstrates commitment to positive patient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t experience and improved patient care for better overall health status.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Four OU Health Physicians clinics in Tulsa have earned PCMH designation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t In Oklahoma City, more than a dozen OU Health Physicians clinics are PCMH-designated.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Studies show that patients who use PCMH clinics are more likely to stay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t healthy because they take advantage of preventive services and screening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t opportunities that alert them to potential health concerns.\\nWhen you choose OU Health Physicians, you get more than a clinic. You get\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t a medical home – a special place with your own doctor and medical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t team who will help you achieve your best health possible, provide answers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t and guidance and help you stay on top of all your health care needs through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t evidence-based care.\\nThe focus of the patient-centered medical home model is preventive and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t proactive healthcare, which builds patient-provider relationships that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t improve patient outcomes. A team approach ensures comprehensive, coordinated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t care that addresses the total health needs of the individual, rather than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t treating incidental health episodes as they arise.\\nCommunication is a core concept of the patient-centered medical home. Communication\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t encompasses not only the exchange of information between patients, families\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t and caregivers, but also include ease of access to medical records. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t result is better management of chronic or complex conditions.\\nAll of these elements not only contribute to better long-term health outcomes,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t but also create a more positive patient experience.

By adopting innovative approaches, OU Health continues to set new standards in patient care and treatment options.\\nOne such advancement is ClearPoint Neuro, Inc.'s\\nSmartFrame OR™\\nplatform, which revolutionizes Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgeries. DBS is a surgical procedure that involves implanting a neurostimulator in the brain to deliver electrical impulses, benefiting patients with movement disorders and certain other neurological conditions. The new technology enables best-in-class accurate electrode placement in the brain while patients are asleep, resulting in faster, more accurate procedures that reduce patient anxiety.\\n“SmartFrame OR represents a paradigm shift for DBS surgeries,” said OU Health neurosurgeon\\nDr. Andrew Conner, M.D.\\n, assistant professor in the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine. Dr. Conner was among the first surgeons to use the device during the FDA Usability Study. OU Health is the first health system in the world to adopt the platform.\\n“This new technology represents a leap forward for DBS surgery. It offers incredibly accurate, consistent, and reliable results. It is truly a game-changer,” Dr. Conner said.\\nMovement disorders affect approximately 42 million people in the United. States. These disorders include conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and others. Common treatments for movement disorders typically involve medications to manage symptoms, physical and occupational therapy, botulinum toxin injections, and surgical options like DBS.\\nTraditionally, patients undergoing a DBS procedure can only be asleep if the procedure is done in an MRI machine; however, due to safety concerns, patients with pacemakers or other such medical devices are unable to undergo the procedure in an MRI environment. For example, pacemakers could heat within the MRI machine, and if the patient is asleep, they are unable to communicate any potentially dangerous discomfort to the surgeons; thus, the procedure must be performed in the operating room.\\nHowever, the accuracy isn’t as fine-tuned as an MRI machine when performing this procedure in the operating room, because it relies on equipment that must be frequently re-calibrated and specially maintained.\\nWith the introduction of SmartFrame OR, OU Health now offers patients the option of undergoing best-in-class accurate electrode placement in the brain in the OR while comfortably asleep.\\nSmartFrame OR is a stereotactic platform featuring a disposable, temporary mount on the skull that facilitates precise electrode placement with best-in-class accuracy. This innovation not only integrates advanced imaging tools for real-time visualization, but also automates adjustments, reducing the need for repeat scans and optimizing patient care during surgery. Furthermore, each platform does not require specialized maintenance and frequent calibration, resulting in consistent and reliable accuracy in every case.\\nThe new SmartFrame OR platform seamlessly integrates with MRI and CT technology, directly in the operating room with high quality precision. This integration and increased accuracy eliminates the previous necessity for awake procedures in the OR providing patients a safer more efficient, and less anxiety-inducing surgical option.\\n“OU Health's adoption of SmartFrame puts us on the global map,” said Dr. Conner. “We're proud to lead the way in patient-centered innovation.\\nRelated Blogs\\nFirst Pediatric Heart Transplant Performed at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health in Decades\\nFeatured, News\\nContinue Reading\\nBreakthrough Type 1 Diabetes Drug Now Offered at OU Health\\nNews\\nContinue Reading\\nOvercoming Glioblastoma: Matt’s Path to Recovery and Research\\nNeurosciences\\nContinue Reading\\nFeatured Blogs\\nFrom Struggle to Strength: Ross’s ...\\nFeatured, Children\\nSara and Jon Helms found out they were expecting their first baby during a particularly busy and stressful period in their lives.

After five months of continuing pain despite chiropractic visits, Jan went to see her doctor. Because of where the pain radiated from, her doctor thought that maybe Jan had damaged her liver in the crash. The news she received could not have been more shocking—Jan had Stage 4 metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer. And if that news wasn’t shocking enough, Jan was given 12 months to live.\\nUterine Carcinosarcoma\\nStage 4 metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma is a type of uterine cancer that has spread beyond the pelvis to other parts of the body. Jan had a tumor on the surface of her liver/diaphragm, and she was having trouble breathing.\\nThe overall 5-year survival for uterine carcinosarcoma is around 20-35% for Stage 3, and the 5-year survival for Stage 4 disease is reported to be around 10%. Uterine carcinosarcomas begin in the lining of the uterus and more than 95% of uterine cancers are carcinomas.\\nIn February 2021, Jan traveled to Texas for surgery, which included a hysterectomy and the removal of other non-vital organs to eliminate the tumors.Following surgery, she started a clinical trial called DUO-E, which involved a combination of treatments:\\nCarboplatin and Paclitaxel\\n: These are the standard of care chemotherapy drugs used to treat endometrial cancer.\\nDurvalumab (IO)\\n: An immunotherapy drug that helps the immune system fight cancer.\\nOlaparib\\n: P PARP inhibitor which targets how cells repair DNA.\\nThe trial had different control groups, with some participants receiving a placebo, others receiving durvalumab and a placebo, another group received Olaparib and a placebo, and the final group receiving both durvalumab and Olaparib. This was a double-blind study meaning that neither the doctor nor the patient knew which group the participants were assigned. Jan received both trial drugs.\\nTransferring to Stephenson Cancer Center\\nJan responded well to the drug. Because she lives in Kansas, her doctors in Texas recommended that she transfer to OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center, which was running the same trial. She transferred her care in August 2021 and continued the clinical trial at Stephenson Cancer Center.\\nDespite a positive response to the drug initially, Jan received bad news in September 2022.\\n“I found out that the cancer had returned, three days after my daughter’s wedding,” said Jan. “I’m so grateful that it was after the wedding, as it would have been a lot more somber.”\\nOU Health gynecologic oncologist\\nDr. Debra Richardson, M.D., FACS, FACOG\\n, professor and Chief in the Section of\\nGynecologic Oncology\\nat the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, surgically removed the cancer. After the resection of the cancer the area received radiation therapy and Jan started chemotherapy with gynecologic oncologist\\nDr. Kathleen Moore, M.D., M.S.\\n, associate director of Clinical Research at Stephenson Cancer Center and professor in the Section of Gynecologic Oncology at OU College of Medicine.\\nThe standard medications for Jan’s treatment included Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab. Lenvatinib works by blocking the growth of cancer cells and cutting off the blood supply that tumors need to grow. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy drug that helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. This combination has a high response rate in recurrent endometrial cancer. However, because Jan had significant side effects, Dr. Moore recommended she try something else, even though the medications were working against the cancer.\\nPhase 1 Clinical Trials\\nThere was no way that Jan was ready to give up. In September 2023, she was enrolled in a Phase 1 clinical trial for a new drug called DB-1303, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADC is a special kind of cancer treatment that combines an antibody and a chemotherapy drug.\\nThe antibody part of DB-1303 searches for a specific protein called HER2neu, found on the surface of some cancer cells. The antibody binds to cancer cells that express HER2neu, the cell internalizes the drug and releases the chemotherapy inside the cancer cell, killing it.\\nBy delivering the chemotherapy drug directly to the cancer cell, DB-1303 helps to kill the cancer cells more effectively. This targeted approach also helps to reduce damage to healthy cells, which can minimize side effects.\\nBy participating in this trial, Jan is not only given access to new drugs before they reach the market, but she is also helping researchers learn more about DB-1303 and its potential to treat HER2-positive cancers. This could lead to new and better treatment options for people with this type of cancer in the future.\\nOutstanding Results\\nJan responded extremely well to DB-1303 with no side effects and a year later, at 71 years old, she has no detectable cancer.\\n“I couldn’t be more thrilled that Jan is thriving on this clinical trial,” said Dr. Richardson. “She has a complete response, which means we cannot detect any evidence of cancer on imaging or physical exam, and she has no cancer symptoms. This is always our goal when treating cancer.”\\nWith such a fantastic response to the clinical trial, Jan will stay on the drug for the foreseeable future.\\n“The carcinosarcoma is very aggressive so I’ll stay on the medication and just keep doing what we’re doing,” said Jan. “I was given 12 months to live and here I am three years later. I was able to see my daughter get married, my son get sober, and my daughter give me a grandson. I feel I have a future now.”\\nCancer clinical trials are research studies aimed at discovering new methods for diagnosing, treating, and managing cancer. These trials involve volunteers, both cancer patients and healthy individuals, to evaluate new treatments or innovative uses of existing ones. Stephenson Cancer Center stands out as the only facility in Oklahoma offering Phase I clinical trials.\\n“OU Health researchers work on new medical solutions every day. For many of us, trial drugs give us an alternative when we’re not responding to traditional treatment,” said Jan. “It’s so important that we participate in new drug testing. If you have the need, go to Stephenson Cancer Center. My experience has been great.”\\nWhile you wait for a diagnosis, seek a second opinion, or consider transferring care for yourself or a loved one, you can count on the expert teams at OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center to support you from diagnosis through survivorship.\\nComplete this form\\nor give us a call at\\n(405) 271-1112\\nto request an appointment.\\nRelated Blogs\\nSigns to Visit Urgent Care or the ER for a Cough\\nBlog\\nContinue Reading\\nComplex Spinal Surgery for a Rare Growth Disorder — Carissah’s Story\\nBlog\\nContinue Reading\\nOvercoming Glioblastoma: Matt’s Path to Recovery and Research\\nBlog\\nContinue Reading\\nFeatured Blogs\\nFrom Struggle to Strength: Ross’s ...\\nFeatured, Children\\nSara and Jon Helms found out they were expecting their first baby during a particularly busy and stressful period in their lives.

In 2019 alone, OU Health provided $115\\n\\t million in charity care for uninsured patients and unreimbursed services.\\n\\t OU Health also serves a disproportionate number of underserved communities,\\n\\t including older adults and children from low-income families. Often relying\\n\\t on government payors, more than 60% of our patients have highly complex\\n\\t health needs. The variety of our patients and our services aligns with\\n\\t the principles of our mission: patient care, education and research to\\n\\t improve the lives of all people.\\nBeyond the Doctor’s Office\\nHealthy living happens every day – through actions you can take to\\n\\t prevent certain health conditions, regular checkups that keep you on track\\n\\t and easy access to specialty care when you need it. OU Health stands by\\n\\t your side at every step along your health journey with the many ways we\\n\\t make sound investments in our community through services and programs\\n\\t that reach far beyond the doors of our facilities.\\nInnovative Research for Improving Community Health\\nIn partnership with University of Oklahoma Centers of Excellence, OU Health\\n\\t supports innovative research intended to improve quality of life in the\\n\\t state. Whether working with the OU Tulsa campus on the Food Is Medicine\\n\\t program and study, supporting the development of smoking cessation technologies\\n\\t or actively participating in the Oklahoma Physicians Research/Resource\\n\\t Network (OKPRN), OU Health invests in innovation happening throughout Oklahoma.\\nEducation for Health Professionals\\nAs Oklahoma’s only comprehensive academic medical center and campus,\\n\\t OU Health serves a critical role in developing the next generation of\\n\\t medical professionals for the state and region. The leading healthcare\\n\\t experts in many medical fields work at OU Health, serving our community\\n\\t and training the strongest possible healthcare workforce for Oklahoma’s future.\\nActivities to Improve Community Health\\nWhile medical professionals across OU Health primarily focus on providing\\n\\t the highest quality healthcare, OU Health staff members at all levels\\n\\t give their time to help make Oklahoma a better, healthier place to live.\\n\\t You’ll find OU Health staff as volunteers in the community through\\n\\t efforts like our\\nLive to Give program\\n, as well as investing in community-based organizations and strategically\\n\\t connecting with partners throughout the community. All activities seek\\n\\t to improve both quality of life and health outcomes for communities we serve.\\nStrategic Efforts in Community Health\\nFor information about the strategic vision and goals of OU Health community\\n\\t health efforts, watch here for updates via our annual report.\\nCommunity Health Needs Assessment\\nBy understanding what’s happening in our communities and completing\\n\\t a thorough examination of health needs, we can more strategically target\\n\\t efforts and programs to create stronger impacts.\\nReview the\\nCommunity Health Needs Assessment Report [pdf]\\nto find out more.\\nCommitment to Good Stewardship\\nThrough the\\n340B Good Stewardship Program [pdf] ,\\nOU Health better serves the community by extending its resources to the\\n\\t benefit of communities across the region.\\nOU Health in the Community\\nCommunity Health Improvement Activities\\nOklahoma City Public Schools Partnership\\n340B Good Stewardship Program\\nAnnual Community Health Reports\\nDiscover what patient-centered care means for you\\nLearn More\\nI want to...\\nView All OU Health Services\\nLog In To Patient Portal\\nRequest Medical Records\\nSend a Greeting\\nSearch eHealth Library\\n700 NE 13th St\\nOklahoma City\\n,\\nOK\\n73104\\nMap + Directions\\nFor Hospital Information:\\n(405) 271-4700\\nFor appointments:\\n(405) 271-2222\\nAbout OU Health\\nBilling & Insurance\\nCalendar & Events\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nCOVID-19 Services & Treatments\\neHealth Library\\nMedical Records\\nNewsroom & Media\\nNotice of Privacy Practices\\nOU Health in the Community\\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\\nPhysician Access & Logins\\nPrice Transparency\\nVendor Registration & Login\\nWays to Give\\nx\\n⚠\\nYour browser is out of date.
